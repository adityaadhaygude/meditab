            Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic used to treat a number of bacterial infections.This includes bone and joint
            infections, intra abdominal infections, certain type of infectious diarrhea, respiratory tract infections,
            skin infections, typhoid fever, and urinary tract infections, among others.For some infections it is used in
            addition to other antibiotics.It can be taken by mouth, in eye drops, or intravenously.<br><br>

            Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and rash.Ciprofloxacin increases the risk of tendon
            rupture.In people with myasthenia gravis, there is worsening muscle weakness.Rates of side effects appear to
            be higher than some groups of antibiotics such as cephalosporins but lower than others such as
            clindamycin.Studies in other animals raise concerns regarding use in pregnancy.No problems were identified,
            however, in the children of a small number of women who took the medication.It appears to be safe during
            breastfeeding.It is a second-generation fluoroquinolone with a broad spectrum of activity that usually
            results in the death of the bacteria.

            <p>Ciprofloxacin is used to treat a wide variety of infections, including infections of bones and joints,
                endocarditis, gastroenteritis, malignant otitis externa, respiratory tract infections, cellulitis,
                urinary tract infections, prostatitis, anthrax, and chancroid.<br>

                Ciprofloxacin only treats bacterial infections; it does not treat viral infections such as the common
                cold. For certain uses including acute sinusitis, lower respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated
                gonorrhea, ciprofloxacin is not considered a first-line agent.<br>

                Ciprofloxacin occupies an important role in treatment guidelines issued by major medical societies for
                the treatment of serious infections, especially those likely to be caused by Gram-negative bacteria,
                including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For example, ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole is one of
                several first-line antibiotic regimens recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the
                treatment of community-acquired abdominal infections in adults.It also features prominently in treatment
                guidelines for acute pyelonephritis, complicated or hospital-acquired urinary tract infection, acute or
                chronic prostatitis,certain types of endocarditis,certain skin infections, and prosthetic joint
                infections.<br>

                In other cases, treatment guidelines are more restrictive, recommending in most cases that older,
                narrower-spectrum drugs be used as first-line therapy for less severe infections to minimize
                fluoroquinolone-resistance development. For example, the Infectious Diseases Society of America
                recommends the use of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones in urinary tract infections be reserved
                to cases of proven or expected resistance to narrower-spectrum drugs such as nitrofurantoin or
                trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.The European Association of Urology recommends ciprofloxacin as an
                alternative regimen for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, but cautions that the
                potential for "adverse events have to be considered".<br>

                Although approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of respiratory infections, ciprofloxacin
                is not recommended for respiratory infections by most treatment guidelines due in part to its modest
                activity against the common respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae."Respiratory quinolones" such
                as levofloxacin, having greater activity against this pathogen, are recommended as first line agents for
                the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in patients with important co-morbidities and in patients
                requiring hospitalization (Infectious Diseases Society of America 2007). Similarly, ciprofloxacin is not
                recommended as a first-line treatment for acute sinusitis.<br>

                Ciprofloxacin is approved for the treatment of gonorrhea in many countries, but this recommendation is
                widely regarded as obsolete due to resistance development
