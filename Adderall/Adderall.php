            Adderall,Adderall XR and Mydayis combination drugs containing four salts of the two enantiomers of
            amphetamine, are central nervous system stimulants of the phenethylamine class.Adderall is used in the
            treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy.It is also used as an athletic
            performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer, and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant.By salt
            content, the active ingredients are 25% levoamphetamine salts and 75% dextroamphetamine salts.

                Adderall is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy (a sleep
                disorder).Long-term amphetamine exposure at sufficiently high doses in some animal species is known to
                produce abnormal dopamine system development or nerve damage,but, in humans with ADHD, pharmaceutical
                amphetamines appear to improve brain development and nerve growth.Reviews of magnetic resonance imaging
                (MRI) studies suggest that long-term treatment with amphetamine decreases abnormalities in brain
                structure and function found in subjects with ADHD, and improves function in several parts of the brain,
                such as the right caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia.<br><br>

                Reviews of clinical stimulant research have established the safety and effectiveness of long-term
                continuous amphetamine use for the treatment of ADHD.Randomized controlled trials of continuous
                stimulant therapy for the treatment of ADHD spanning 2 years have demonstrated treatment effectiveness
                and safety.Two reviews have indicated that long-term continuous stimulant therapy for ADHD is effective
                for reducing the core symptoms of ADHD (i.e., hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity), enhancing
                quality of life and academic achievement, and producing improvements in a large number of functional
                outcomesacross 9 categories of outcomes related to academics, antisocial behavior, driving,
                non-medicinal drug use, obesity, occupation, self-esteem, service use (i.e., academic, occupational,
                health, financial, and legal services), and social function.One review highlighted a nine-month
                randomized controlled trial of amphetamine treatment for ADHD in children that found an average increase
                of 4.5 IQ points, continued increases in attention, and continued decreases in disruptive behaviors and
                hyperactivity.Another review indicated that, based upon the longest follow-up studies conducted to date,
                lifetime stimulant therapy that begins during childhood is continuously effective for controlling ADHD
                symptoms and reduces the risk of developing a substance use disorder as an adult.<br><br>

                Current models of ADHD suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain's
                neurotransmitter systems;these functional impairments involve impaired dopamine neurotransmission in the
                mesocorticolimbic projection and norepinephrine neurotransmission in the noradrenergic projections from
                the locus coeruleus to the prefrontal cortex.Psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine are
                effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these
                systems.Approximately 80% of those who use these stimulants see improvements in ADHD symptoms.Children
                with ADHD who use stimulant medications generally have better relationships with peers and family
                members, perform better in school, are less distractible and impulsive, and have longer attention
                spans.The Cochrane Collaboration's reviews on the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults
                with pharmaceutical amphetamines stated that short-term studies have demonstrated that these drugs
                decrease the severity of symptoms, but they have higher discontinuation rates than non-stimulant
                medications due to their adverse side effects.A Cochrane Collaboration review on the treatment of ADHD
                in children with tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome indicated that stimulants in general do not
                make tics worse, but high doses of dextroamphetamine could exacerbate tics in some individuals.</p>
