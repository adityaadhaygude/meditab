            <p>Trazodone has the following medical uses:<br>

                <b>Unipolar depression, with or without anxiety:</b><br>Major depressive disorder (MDD), also known
                simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by at least two weeks of low mood that is
                present across most situations.It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally
                enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause.People may also occasionally have false
                beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot.Some people have periods of depression separated by
                years in which they are normal, while others nearly always have symptoms present.Major depressive
                disorder can negatively affect a person's personal life, work life, or education, as well as sleeping,
                eating habits, and general health.Between 2â€“8% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and about
                50% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.<br>
                <b>Anxiety disorder:</b><br>Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by
                significant feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events, and fear is a reaction
                to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a fast heart rate and
                shakiness.<br>
                <b>Insomnia</b><br>Insomnia, also known as sleeplessness, is a sleep disorder in which people have
                trouble sleeping. They may have difficulty falling asleep, or staying asleep as long as desired.
